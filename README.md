Practice

### Do these practice problems to learn basic Java coding

In this set of practice problems, you'll practice using the following:

- Math operations
- Methods
- Conditionals
- Iteration
- Arrays
- Strings
- Github

The skeleton code for these problems is at the following link: https://github.com/USFCS112/javaGit_warmup_problems (see Java classes inside src/main). See instructions below on getting started.

### Overview

The goal of this set of practice problems is to help you gear up for learning Java. This course is a fast paced class, and incoming students are expected to know the basics of programming such as methods, loops, conditionals, and arrays before starting the class. If you took an intro programming class in another programming language, you should still be able to do these problems after reviewing basic Java syntax. The provided exercises are not meant to demonstrate good object-oriented design; their main purpose is to allow students to practice working with arrays, loops and conditionals. 

If you find yourself struggling with these problems, please consider completing an online Java course or carefully going through an introductory Java textbook *and* completing the programming exercises. Though there may be partial or complete solutions to some of these questions on various sites like StackOverflow, it is expected that you solve these problems *without* using the Internet as a resource. 

### Getting Started
We will be using IntelliJ and Github in this course.
IntelliJ is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). IDE is a piece of software that makes developing code easier: it contains an editor that provides clever code completion,  a debugger, refactoring tools, and build automation tools.

1. Download [IntelliJ here]https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). Select the Community edition (it's free).
2. Download [Java 8 here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) You need the JDK (Java SE Development Kit).
3. Make sure IntelliJ  is configured correctly to use Java 8.

Github is a web-based version control system.  All assignments in this class will be posted and submitted using github. Create a github user account if you do not already have one and sign up for the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

It is easy to access github from IntelliJ. Here is a video that shows you how to clone a github repository  (create a copy of it on your local machine)  in IntelliJ: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRKrzN0LwUw
Once you clone the skeleton code to IntelliJ, you can fill in the code in the provided Java classes and run each class to test if your methods work correctly (I added a main method to each class, although it's not ideal from the design point of view). There is no need for you to submit your code since this problems are just for practice.

### Practice Questions

This practice assignment contains the following classes: `ConversionsHelper`, `MathHelper`, `ArrayHelper`, and `StringHelper`. 
To complete this practice assignment, complete each class as specified in the comments above each method and the `//TODO` notes in each class. It is recommended you complete the classes in the order specified below:

1. `ConversionHelper`
2. `MathHelper`
3. `ArrayHelper`
4. `StringHelper`
